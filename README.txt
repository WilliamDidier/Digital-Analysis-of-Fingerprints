To compile our code : ./Compiler.sh

To render the documentation : ./Doc.sh (will open html version of the doc in firefox)

To test the geometric functions : ./Geometric.sh <Image path>

To test the different rotations : ./Rotation.sh
Since the skin elasticity isn't working as expected with the new version of the code 
please use a code that was pushed before the 15th of February if you want an 
output similar to the one in the report. 

To test the pressure variations (with no anisotropic filtering) : ./Pressure.sh

The rest of the tests are detailed in the pdf report.
